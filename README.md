Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

About the company
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. With a program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

 The director of marketing has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

To do that we will examine the business question: 'what is the most effective marketing strategy to converting Cyclistic’s casual riders to annul memberships?'


1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

This report will try to awnser the following question :
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

I started with a dataset for the past 12 months September 2021 - August 2022. The data set for each month is in csv format and details every ride logged by Cyclistic customers. This data has been made publicly available via license by Motivate International Inc. and the city of Chicago . All user’s personal data has been scrubbed for privacy.

We used SQL bigquery to clean and prepare the data for analysis
Tableau to visualize our findins 

That data tell us that:

1. The causal riders prefer to use the service during the weekends. The long term members conversly utilised the service more-so throughout the typical work week i.e (Monday- friday)
2. The casual riders spent on average longer time per ride than the members, this we can see by examining weekly data throughout the year.
3. Casual riders tend to ride more so in the warmer months of Chicago, June-August and during the winter they hardly use the service. Although members also tend to ride more in the summer, the do still consistently utilize the bikes. Even during the winter, the numbers show a decent amount of use.
4. Long term riders tend to stick more with classic bikes as opposed to the docked or electric bikes.
 
This analysis suggests the the members use the bikes more as mode of transportations and less as a form of recreation.
