Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

About the company
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. With a program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

 The director of marketing has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

To do that we will examine the business question: 'what is the most effective marketing strategy to converting Cyclistic’s casual riders to annul memberships?'


1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

This report will try to awnser the following question :
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Wit a dataset for the past 12 month september 2021 - augost 2022, Each data set for each month is in csv format and details every ride logged by Cyclistic customers. This data has been made publicly available via license by Motivate International Inc. and the city of Chicago . All user’s personal data has been scrubbed for privacy.

We used SQL bigquery to clean and prepare the data for analysis
Tableau to visualize our findins 

That data tell us that:

1. The causal riders prefer to use the service during the weekends. The long term members conversly utilised the service more-so throughout the typical work week i.e (Monday- friday)
2. the Casual riders spent on average longer time per ride and the menbers are more consintent with it, this we can see it in the weeks and during the whole year.
3. Casual users tended to ride more so in the warmer months of Chicago, June- August and during the winter they hardly use bike, Although members also tended to ride more in the summer,their used constatly and even during the winter we can still finds we decent numbers or rides
4. Long term riders tended to stick more with classic bikes as opposed to the docked or electric bikes.
 
This analysis suggest the the members used the bikes more as mind of transportations and less as recrations.
